# Pandas-profiling
For my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), I utilized pandas profiling, a powerful tool in Python, to generate comprehensive reports on the dataset. pandas profiling automates the generation of detailed statistics and interactive visualizations, offering insights into the dataset's structure, missing values, distributions, correlations, and more. This approach helped me quickly gain a holistic understanding of the data, facilitating efficient exploration and identification of key patterns and issues.
